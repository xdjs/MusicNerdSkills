"""Resolver reachability audit for the Music Nerd Skills plugin (repo root).

Enforces that the bundle's RESOLVER.md routing table stays honest as skills are
added/removed — the "no dark skills" guarantee. A skill that exists but isn't
reachable from the resolver is "a surgeon the
hospital can't find"; a route that points at a deleted skill sends the agent
nowhere.

Two findings, both fatal (exit 1):
  1. UNREACHABLE — a skills/<name>/SKILL.md with no row in RESOLVER.md.
  2. BROKEN ROUTE — an `mn-*` token in RESOLVER.md with no matching skill dir.

Usage:
  python3 scripts/check_resolvable.py                 # default: repo root (skills/ + RESOLVER.md)
  python3 scripts/check_resolvable.py path/to/subdir  # any dir with skills/ + RESOLVER.md
